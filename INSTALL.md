### Building Divi

See doc/build-*.md for instructions on building the various
elements of the Divi Core reference implementation of Divi.

Easiest way to build the project is either with `Docker` or `Ubuntu`.
Make sure to head on over to `docs/build-docker.md` or `docs/build-ubuntu.md`
if you're having troubles using other OS specific `.md` instructions.
