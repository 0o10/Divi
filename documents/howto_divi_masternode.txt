How to start a masternode:

Requirements:
A machine running a wallet.  This will be referred to as the wallet.
Another machine that is publicly reachable by the entire network it will be added to.  This will be referred to as the masternode.

Step 1:  On the wallet make sure funds are available
divi-cli getbalance

If funds are not available on this wallet create an account and send funds to it from a wallet with the collateral.
divi-cli getaccountaddress masternodes
DBmD4hcu8mYhRhvjm7BDXzUSQcdpL9HZwf

From the wallet with the collateral...
divi-cli sendtoaddress DBmD4hcu8mYhRhvjm7BDXzUSQcdpL9HZwf 50000
972910fc4ad6ff93e41eefeca0bd5e2593d316450fe85fb755cf89c758792b12
divi-cli gettransaction 972910fc4ad6ff93e41eefeca0bd5e2593d316450fe85fb755cf89c758792b12
#wait for confirmations...

Back to the wallet machine...
divi-cli masternode genkey

divi-cli getaccountaddress mn1
DR4z3m44R6pCqCgmpFjYBmgvzHGDGvzukj

If you have a specific wallet address with the funds, for example an account named 'masternodes'
divi-cli sendfrom masternodes DR4z3m44R6pCqCgmpFjYBmgvzHGDGvzukj 10000
If the funds are in the default account use...
divi-cli sendtoaddress DR4z3m44R6pCqCgmpFjYBmgvzHGDGvzukj 10000
3f83abbd591214ab8f185ca4942623daa81f0ffdb7094a1e4666ea1944a6eca7
divi-cli gettransaction 3f83abbd591214ab8f185ca4942623daa81f0ffdb7094a1e4666ea1944a6eca7
wait for confirmations...

Then you should be able see the masternode output.
divi-cli masternode outputs
[
    {
        "txhash" : "3f83abbd591214ab8f185ca4942623daa81f0ffdb7094a1e4666ea1944a6eca7",
        "outputidx" : 0
    }
]

In the wallet data directory, edit masternodes.conf.  The usual path is ~/.divi/masternode.conf
Add the line below, with your information.  There are example lines at the top that tell you which thing goes where.  Mine looks like this...
mn1 10.27.199.2:51472 87JoBcPp9JWhGxf9NaND6Jp8MRzB1U8A4BmeLgqjNdwog4RgoDr 3f83abbd591214ab8f185ca4942623daa81f0ffdb7094a1e4666ea1944a6eca7 0

Now you are ready to set up your masternode.  Go to the data directory of your masternode, and edit divi.conf.  It should look something like this...

addnode=10.27.199.4:51472
rpcuser=byrdisword
rpcpassword=byrdiswordbyrdiswordbyrdisword
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
listen=0
server=1
daemon=1
logtimestamps=1
maxconnections=256
masternode=1
externalip=10.27.199.2
bind=10.27.199.2
masternodeaddr=10.27.199.2:51472
masternodeprivkey=87JoBcPp9JWhGxf9NaND6Jp8MRzB1U8A4BmeLgqjNdwog4RgoDr

Now you are ready to restart your wallet and masternode.  
Stop them both using divi-cli stop (if they are running.)  
Start them both using divid
Run on your wallet...
divi-cli startmasternode alias false mn1
{
    "overall" : "Successfully started 1 masternodes, failed to start 0, total 1",
    "detail" : [
        {
            "alias" : "mn1",
            "result" : "successful",
            "error" : ""
        }
    ]
}

Run on your masternode...
divi-cli startmasternode local false
Masternode successfully started

Common problems include not syncing the masternode machine with the rest of the network, and not allowing collateral transactions to collect enough confirmations, and other various network issues.  If you have issues, refer to end of your debug.log on both the wallet and masternode to look for clues.
